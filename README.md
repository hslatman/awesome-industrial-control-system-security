            AttkFinder is a tool that performs static program analysis of PLC programs, and
produce Data-oriented Attack vectors. In a nutshell, AttkFinder takes PLC programs written
under the standard IEC-61131-3 in xml-format or structured text,
and builds a Data-Flow graph (DFG), a Control-Flow graph (CFG) and translates the program
into a Structured Intermediate Representation Language (STIR) version. A symbolic
execution engine analyses the stir-version code searching for attack vectors that can be
exploited by a malicious actuator.​

            Redpoint is a Digital Bond research project to enumerate ICS applications and devices using nmap extensions.

            The Redpoint tools use legitimate protocol or application commands to discover and enumerate devices and applications. 
            There is no effort to exploit or crash anything, but be wise and careful.

            The second version of the Graphical Realism Framework for Industrial Control Simulations (GRFICS) is a framework for realistic industrial control simulations that uses Unity 3D game engine for simulating industrial control systems. GRFICS provides users with a full virtual industrial control system (ICS) network to practice common attacks including command injection, man-in-the-middle, and buffer overflows, and visually see the impact of their attacks in the 3D visualization. Users can also practice their defensive skills by properly segmenting the network with strong firewall rules, or writing intrusion detection rules.
